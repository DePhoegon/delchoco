Welcome to the Wonderful World of Chocobos.

This mod is intended to be with DePhoegons' Reclaim  [ Is on forge & on Github ]

Currently, in active development to fix 'Chococraft 4' for 1.18.2 & theme it for my Decorative & resource reclaiming, Vanilla+ like mod.
-Please forgive me as I am learning as I go & working with ...  unfamiliar bits & bobs because I REALLY want chocobos myself & no one else was seeming to do it.

The Press files include the change & by date.

There are many changes coming, and some visual rework on other things.

Some future updates to be hand.

-- Is a modpack meant around chocobos, exploration, Horses, & Llamas, and decoration around larger animal stall style building.
-This is the main mod it will 'require', future plans will call for blocks that exist within this mod.

I can produce a depenancy free version (from my mod), but it will still require
-JEI (for now, just bad book in it atm)
-Configured (just highly suggested)
-Patchouli (Guide Book)
