-- Is a modpack meant around chocobos, exploration, Horses, & Llamas, and decoration around larger animal stall style building.

I can produce a depenancy free version (from my mod), but it will still require
-JEI (for now, just bad book in it atm)
-Configured (just highly suggested)
-Patchouli (Guide Book)
