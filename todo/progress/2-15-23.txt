Fixed Critical Flaw with getting Uuid
-- it works in dev environment, Crashes live environment
Used isControlledByLocalInstance() to correct.
--isLocalPlayer() (which is nested down in that method) misleadingly annotated.
Checking for Detached Camera works on live account.

Chocobo now disappears (visually) for player riding, in first person, & not other players of the server.

setup a Dev & Live client testing.

--------

Finalized Chocobos Movement over/through water.
- All Chocobos 'walk' on lava, but only those which have isFlame can survive.
-- Will attempt to navigate or TP out of lava
- Evened out the walking over lava & water
- All Chocobos 'walk' on water, except for Those with water breathing
-- water breathing sinks to the ground.
