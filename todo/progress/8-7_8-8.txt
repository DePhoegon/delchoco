Under the Hood Changes
- Adjusted 'stay command'
--  removed wondering (allowing it to look around, and seem alive)

- Added avoidance of llamas
== Llamas have done some evil things in the past, & world has spread

- Touched the chocobo saddle inventory up.
== Still can't figure out the rendering layer order.
== added in Capabilty handling on the off chance it gets used.
== Added quickMoveStack
==~~ blacklisted the saddle slot, because things happen.
