-- Unsure wtf is going on .

Chocobo Inventory Addressed.
- ChocoboEntity.java
= Code cleanup
= Made ItemStackHandler chocoboInventory a fixed size (45)
= Created ItemStackHandler tierOneItemStackHandler as a fixed size (15)
= Created ItemStackHandler tierTwoItemStackHandler as a fixed size (45)
= Created ints  for above item handlers & for use of inventory sizes
= used chocoboInventory as the backplane
== synced the inventories on update (from any itemhandler inventory)
== Used Slot adjusting to properly change address the correct slot from small to large
== made chocoboInventory Explictedly call the sync to the small inventory.
==== unexpected issues came from reassigning a slotadjust number.
= made updates to saddleItemStackHandler
== made return false on isItemValid
=== prevents equipping it while the menu is open.
~~ Intended to equip saddles & saddle bags/packs by right clicking the chocobo
== made drop chocoboInventory as a hole on change.
=== ensuring that no duplication & all 3 ItemStackHandlers empty out
= Removed If (!getSaddle().isEmpty()) check for NBT save on chocoboInventory.
== No need to not save it, as inventory size is not set
= Removed reconfigureInventory()
== Not needed in the slightest anymore.
= Removed getSaddleCount()
== Not needed anymore

-ModRegistry.java
= Changed 'Inventoryslots' in the saddlebags/pack
== using ints in ChocoboEntity, to keep the count the same.

-SaddleBagContainer.java
= some code cleanup
= refreshSLots() Addresed
== enhanced switch used.
== bindInventorySmall, now uses tierOneItemStackHandler
== bindInventoryBig, now uses tierTwoItemStackHandler
= Corrected bindInventorySmall() & bindInventoryBig()
== redundant checks, now using int variable instead of coded there.

- SlotChocoboSaddle.java
= Is Slothandler for saddleslot inside the menus drawn up.
== boolean mayPlace()
~~~ Set to false, (prevents derpy interactions)
~~~ Chocobos now require rightclicking with saddle/saddlebag/saddlepack in had to 'equip' them.


Quirky Notes.
-- If for some reason, The chocobo gets items stuck inside the inventory.
--= Equipping it with any kind of saddle, will cause the inventory to drop.
### Thematic reason, of it falling out of the feathers as you equip it's saddle when you click on it.
