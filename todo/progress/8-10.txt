Reworked Chocobo Models
------------------------
-- Making Chicobo models textures from scratch*  recolors
== 'borrowed' the code model data from chococraft X.x

- Going to remake the textures for adult chocobo, to the pallets chosen for the chicobos.

Goal theming chocobos to native blocks/items in games pallet wise.
-Intend to keep as many color palettes as possible from the base game
== Will pull pallets from expected mods to be used with it.
~~ Biomes o Plenty, etc.  (might expand on chocobos, with modpacks & bridge mods, though way down the list & only for theme'd areas.)


Purposefully diverging from chococraft4, & shifted the namespace for compatability sake of entities (for w/e reason you'd have both)

Adjustments to come to move the mod into my design more.
