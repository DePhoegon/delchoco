Taken Steps
- Added in java classes
- merged config file into one
-- Both used Common Space
- Removed Attribute addition for 'horse'
-- Can roll it directly into the Chocobo Class
- Added fallback config values



To Do
- Change 'Save Chocobo'
-- include the following
= Color
= scale
== scale sets scaleMod
= Gender
= generation #
= Stats
== Strength
== Armor
== Armor Toughness
== HP
== Speed
== Stamina
= Abilities
== Flame blood
== water Breathing
== Poison Immune
== Wither Immune
= Inventories
== Saddle
== Armor
== Weapon
== Gen Inventory
= Null out Inventory on death respawn
== on Death they dropped their inventory if killed (or it vanishes when forcefully de-spawned/discarded via command override, /kill drops loot)
= Null out Leash Floats
= Set Movement Type to WANDER (in save)
- Test, Test, Re-Test, & Test again
