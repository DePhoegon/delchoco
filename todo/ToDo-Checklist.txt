Consider Size variance
- 60% range
-- -30 to 10 for 'female' chocobo
-- -10 to 30 for 'male' chocobos
---- Maybe -30 to 20  & -20 to 30
- Use some math that would use a random parents size modifier to effect the baby gender range
- set hard limits (consider 80% range -40 to 40)
-- use scale to set per chocobo
