Double Check
- Whistle functions on underwater chocobo

Test 'Renaming' Ability by non-taming player.

Create Colored versions of Saddle Packs
- Change Saddle registry to split into saddle, small saddle, & large saddle class files
--  Swap to instanceof use
=== com.dephoegon.delchoco.client.renderer.layers.LayerSaddle.java
===-- Will Need to split ResourceLocation for as many saddle colors that get used
- Register new saddles to do color'd versions directly
-- Dyes will be used for collar color changes

Consider
- Random Chocobo Names (not Likely)

ChocoboInventoryScreen
- protected void renderBg() [line 48]
-- Modify
== this.blit(matrixStack, i - 24, j + 10, 0, 204, 27, 33);
~~ [27] width,
~~= allow for 3 Slots visually,
~~= Measure Pixels between, to use in SaddleBagContainer

Modify all 3 Chocobo_inventory pngs identically

-----

SaddleBagContainer
- public void refreshslots() [line 24]
-- Modify
== between Line 27/28
~~ Add slots
this.addSlot(new chocoboEquipmentSlot(chocobo.chocoboArmorHandler/chocoboWeaponHandler, 0, X#, 18))

use of chocoboEquipmentSlot as the SlotItemHandler
- Prevents Quick Move
- Prevents Adding while in the menu
- Keeps behavior the same between saddle, weapon, armor
-- Only equipable via in world use on chocobo

art assets for chocobo weapons/armors

Work on Chocobo Render model to show 'something' for armor & weapons
- make layer for armor & weapons 'on Chocobo'

ChocoboRender.java (client.renderer.entities)
- [line 76] ChocoboRenderer
-- Add new Layers
--- this.addLayer(new LayerArmor(this))
--- this.addLayer(new LayerWeapon(this))

Create Java class files (client.renderer.layers)
- LayerArmor
- LayerWeapon

Use [ getTier() ] {TieredItem.java - source}
-- For LayerWeapon

use [ getMaterial() ] {ChocoboArmorItems.java - source}
-- For LayerArmor

Use Switch, Default to lowest Intended (Does not use all tiers/armor materials)

Create layer PNGs for said Items
