-Verify Chocobo Movements
= 'Swimming'
= Falling
= Gliding

Finalize Glide/Fall speeds for chocobos not being ridden.
- Use saddles for variables
- Use Color for variables

Consider
-- Such vastly different movement, swapping Water breathing on & off of those chocobo would be an option
-- Unsure

Double Check
- Whistle functions on underwater chocobo
- Prior TODOs
-- Validate if they are or are not done.

Test 'Renaming' Ability by non-taming player.

Removed Chocopedia - touch ups
- color collars 'center spot' to identify male/female on tamed
- extend feathers on male untamed chocobo
-- possible lighter color on plumes as well

Create Collar Color changes
- com.dephoegon.delchoco.client.renderer.layers.layerCollar.java
-- New NBT on Chocobo to show collars
=== Add in via Chocobo.java
===-- Default current (red)

Create Colored versions of Saddle Packs
- Change Saddle registry to split into saddle, small saddle, & large saddle class files
--  Swap to instanceof use
=== com.dephoegon.delchoco.client.renderer.layers.LayerSaddle.java
===-- Will Need to split ResourceLocation for as many saddle colors that get used
- Register new saddles to do color'd versions directly
-- Dyes will be used for collar color changes

Consider
- Random Chocobo Names (not Likely)
