Layer Transparency
- Got a method to set a layer to some level of transparency
-- Plumes are 'see-through' ish
-- armor is just transparent enough to look sorta buried in feathers
- Scale doesn't work as intended.
-- Would need to make a new model, &/or rework the model body in unique ways.
---- Not worth doing.
------ using transparency

ToDos'
- Remake layer
-- Create layer for untamed plumes to stack & get it's own transparency
---- It's worth, just time-consuming
