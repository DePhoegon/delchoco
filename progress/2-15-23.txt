Fixed Critical Flaw with getting Uuid
-- it works in dev environment, Crashes live environment
Used isControlledByLocalInstance() to correct.
--isLocalPlayer() (which is nested down in that method) misleadingly annotated.
Checking for Detached Camera works on live account.

Chocobo now disappears (visually) for player riding, in first person, & not other players of the server.

setup a Dev & Live client testing.
